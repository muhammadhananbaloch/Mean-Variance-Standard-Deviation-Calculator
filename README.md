# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
First project for Data Analysis with Python certification by freeCodeCamp. Implements calculate() using Numpy to compute mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of rows, columns, and elements in a 3x3 matrix from a list of 9 digits. Raises ValueError for lists with fewer than 9 elements. Includes tests.
