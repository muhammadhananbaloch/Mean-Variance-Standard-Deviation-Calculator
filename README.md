# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
This repository contains the first project for the Data Analysis with Python certification by freeCodeCamp. The project involves creating a function named calculate() using Numpy to compute the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3x3 matrix.

The function takes a list of 9 digits as input, converts it into a 3x3 Numpy array, and returns a dictionary with the calculated statistics for the rows, columns, and the flattened matrix. If the input list has less than 9 elements, a ValueError is raised.

The repository includes:

mean_var_std.py: The main script containing the calculate() function.
main.py: A script to test the function during development.
test_module.py: Unit tests for the project.
